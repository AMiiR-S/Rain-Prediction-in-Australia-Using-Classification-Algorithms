Instructions
In this notebook, you will practice all the classification algorithms that we have learned in this course.

Below, is where we are going to use the classification algorithms to create a model based on our training data and evaluate our testing data using evaluation metrics learned in the course.

We will use some of the algorithms taught in the course, specifically:

Linear Regression
KNN
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
SVM
We will evaluate our models using:

Accuracy Score
Jaccard Index
F1-Score
LogLoss
Mean Absolute Error
Mean Squared Error
R2-Score
Finally, you will use your models to generate the report at the end.

About The Dataset
The original source of the data is Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology and the latest data can be gathered from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/.

The dataset to be used has extra columns like 'RainToday' and our target is 'RainTomorrow', which was gathered from the Rattle at https://bitbucket.org/kayontoga/rattle/src/master/data/weatherAUS.RData

This dataset contains observations of weather metrics for each day from 2008 to 2017. The weatherAUS.csv dataset includes the following fields:
